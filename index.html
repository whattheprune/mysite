            I had two steaks, it is date night. She is coming over any minute. One steak disappeared. Suspect might be in the picture. What is this? Am I allergic to detergent? What are you absolutely certain of, despite not having a shred of proof? Garbage trucks have loud brakes to give us one last chance to get the bins out. My cat thinks I'm a lazy dumbass. That you're a bot account because this question's been asked multiple times in just the last few days. UFOs	 are 	extra-terrestrial in origin, but they’re		just 	survey 	drones       from 	far 	flung		 civilizations. I'm certain there's more to this world than meets the eye, even without proof.There's a woman out there who I would find beautiful and who would marry me. I just can't find her. Drake Won. He played the long game. Tradesperson removed all shower tiles and said he will be back the next day to do the waterproofing. 	Has 	not 	replied 	since, and we can't use our shower until 3 days AFTER the waterproofing is installed. REA won't use a different contractor. What are my options as a renter? 	click for some <a href="genpoem.html" class="showerlink">showerthoughts.</a>	It sucks	 to tell someone I need a 	compliment

            My female barber started opening up sexually after becoming single and I can't tell if she's interested in me, I have room temperature IQ, is she interested? Is "c*nt" considered particularly offensive in America? AITA for being brutally honest as to why I declined marrying him after saying yes to the ring?Is what Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) doing to himself considered body dysmorphia? What should I name my boat in sea of thieves?<span style="font-size: 1.3em">Dogs in Japan know Japanese.</span>
            That immediately made me feel better lol.  
            A lack of food, water and shelter results in violent thoughts.

            So this happened today, the barista handed me my venti coffee and the lid was not on all the way, obviously you can see the mess it made but also all my electronics are down there, I emailed customer service but honestly I am not sure how to handle this, for reference I just bought this car a couple months ago, it’s a 2020Sentra. A good cup of tea. Do I need to check my bank account before I pay the vital bills? Update: He broke up with me and called me a m*rderer.</i> AITA for wanting to leave my husband after 27 years of marriage? </i> What	 can 	I 	cook 		that’s 	easy with hamburger? It's super sad, but thank God you didn't have kids with this maniac. Wash your hands of all of them and let them continue to go down the hole they all dug for themselves.
