                    I had two steaks, it is date night. She is coming over any minute. One steak disappeared. Suspect might be in the picture. What is this? Am I allergic to detergent? What are you absolutely certain of, despite not having a shred of proof? Garbage trucks have loud brakes to give us one last chance to get the bins out. My cat thinks I'm a lazy dumbass. That you're a bot account because this question's been asked multiple times in just the last few days. UFOs	 are 	extra-terrestrial in origin, but they’re		just 	survey 	drones       from 	far 	flung		 civilizations. I'm certain there's more to this world than meets the eye, even without proof.There's a woman out there who I would find beautiful and who would marry me. I just can't find her. Drake Won.

Has 	not 	replied 	since, and we can't use our shower until 3 days AFTER the waterproofing is installed. REA won't use a different contractor. What are my options as a renter? 	click for some Just try treating them how you wanted to be treated. Dont treat them as strangers. How i make friends is like how i like to be treated. I want to be treated as a real friend. I know some men are resistant to this but if you’re finding it difficult to meet friends you can switch the bumble setting to BFF. It is difficult. People are pretty wrapped up in routine; wake up, chase money, raise the kids, go to bed, repeat. What happens to consciousness after we die? or at least what is our best guess for it? This is spot on and gives me peace since I am being cremated. What about what Jesus says on the cross to the man who was crucified next to Him? I only drink 1L a day, terrible I know! I want to change this but unsure how much I should be aiming for. I am too embarrassed to say. A cure for cancer WOULD be economically viable. Whatever. It obviously has meaning for them. But it holds no great meaning for me.... i'm not really interested and as i'm not Aboriginal? I can't see why i should be greatly interested? I'm not spiritual. I'm an atheist. Yeah... I get that various cultures on earth have all sorts of customs etc they believe in or want to practice. Fine. Free country! But it's not my thing. I truly have no interest and dont see why in a free & democratic, secular nation? I'm being told it should mean so much to me??? And that i should happily participate?

                    My female barber started opening up sexually after becoming single and I can't tell if she's interested in me, I have room temperature IQ, is she interested? Is "c*nt" considered particularly offensive in America? AITA for being brutally honest as to why I declined marrying him after saying yes to the ring?Is what Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) doing to himself considered body dysmorphia? What should I name my boat in sea of thieves?

                So this happened today, the barista handed me my venti coffee and the lid was not on all the way, obviously you can see the mess it made but also all my electronics are down there, I emailed customer service but honestly I am not sure how to handle this, for reference I just bought this car a couple months ago, it’s a 2020Sentra. A good cup of tea. Do I need to check my bank account before I pay the vital bills? Update: He broke up with me and called me a m*rderer.</i> AITA for wanting to leave my husband after 27 years of marriage? </i> What	 can 	I 	cook 		that’s 	easy with hamburger? It's super sad, but thank God you didn't have kids with this maniac. Wash your hands of all of them and let them continue to go down the hole they all dug for themselves. This slave ( ye ) can't read a book, so contracts. It sounds a bit imaginary. The guy admires Hitler, he was also a geek Until he got power from a population of fools. I think most like it, I’m a kiwi, and the vibe I always got from it was that (at least in the past) Australians were proud, they looked after their mates, their neighbours and their families and it was a factor in making the country a strong and vibrant community… same way Waitangi Day was once a celebration of unity… one love…of course New Zealand and Australia have had their celebration days turned into the opposite of unity now. A day that is painted (at least by our journalists) as a day of division… These days the country is turning into a free for all Hell scape where the advantaged take advantage over the disadvantaged, end game monopoly board game style… I guess the party and idealism of looking after each other had to end at some point. Just watched my partner pull out the strainer, then proceed to pour the magic elixir down the drain. Marry or Break it off? Drain before adding the powder, but leave a little bit of water in the bottom so it's not too dry. If its a cup of noodles then leave the water in and make a it a soup

                After everything that's been said and done, after proclaiming that he's going to talk about whatever he feels like and nobody can stop him, the one thing that Kanye has remained completely silent on and never reveals anything about or elaborates on is the thing which, according to him, was the straw that broke the camel's back - the 'exploitative business deals' and how he was 'raped by 5 Jewish businessmen once every 2 years'.
